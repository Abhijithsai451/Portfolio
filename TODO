# 🚀 Portfolio AI Assistant - Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the technical implementation, architectural decisions, and current progress of the Abhijith Sai Portfolio AI project.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is built as a **Multi-Service RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline** designed for high performance and scalability.

### 1. **Web Gateway Service (FastAPI)**
*   **Role**: Acts as the reverse proxy and entry point for the entire application.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Serves the static Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS).
    *   Proxies Chat Requests to the internal AI service.
    *   Implements **Rate Limiting** (SlowAPI) to prevent API abuse.
    *   Exposes **Prometheus Metrics** for performance monitoring.
    *   Handles GZip compression for faster asset delivery.

### 2. **AI Chat Service (FastAPI)**
*   **Role**: The "Brain" of the application, handling all ML and logic.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   **OpenAI Integration**: Uses `gpt-4o-mini` for chat and `text-embedding-3-small` for semantic search.
    *   **Vector Pipeline**: Uses **ChromaDB** to store and query the portfolio knowledge base.
    *   **Voice Engine**: Integrated OpenAI **TTS-1** (`alloy` voice) for high-quality audio responses.
    *   **RAG Logic**: Dynamically retrieves the top 3 most relevant context chunks from the knowledge base for every user query.

### 3. **Data & Cache Layer**
*   **Redis**: High-speed caching for AI context and session management to reduce LLM latency.
*   **Knowledge Base**: A structured `data/` directory containing resume details, project descriptions, and skill sets in Markdown and Text formats.

## ✅ Detailed Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core AI Infrastructure
- [x] **API Migration**: Successfully migrated from local Ollama/SentenceTransformers to OpenAI API for reliability and speed.
- [x] **Embedding Standardization**: Implemented 1536-dimensional OpenAI embeddings across the vector database.
- [x] **Error Handling**: Implemented a "Skip-on-Error" indexing loop where the service remains functional even if specific knowledge chunks fail to process.
- [x] **Async Processing**: Refactored the entire chat pipeline to be fully asynchronous, preventing UI blocking.

### Phase 2: Frontend & UX
- [x] **Premium UI**: Developed a glassmorphism-inspired chat widget that matches the dark-themed portfolio.
- [x] **Dual Interaction Modes**: Successfully implemented a seamless toggle between "Text Only" and "Voice Enabled" modes.
- [x] **Dynamic Indicators**: Added typing animations and "thinking" states to simulate human-like interaction.
- [x] **Sample Questions**: Implemented a "Recruiter Quick-Start" with pre-defined buttons for common inquiries.

### Phase 3: Systems & Stability
- [x] **Unified Imports**: Optimized code sharing between services via `utils/imports_file.py`.
- [x] **Centralized Logging**: Structured JSON logging for easier debugging in cloud environments.
- [x] **Dependency Audit**: Cleaned up conflicting libraries (specifically `httpx` and `openai` versions).
- [x] **Security**: Integrated `TrustedHostMiddleware` and `CORSMiddleware` with secure configurations.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Cleanup 

To prepare for Hugging Face Deployment, the following "Platform-Specific" clutter was removed:
*   [x] **GitHub Actions**: Removed legacy `.github/workflows`.
*   [x] **Railway**: Deleted `railway.json`.
*   [x] **Netlify**: Deleted `netlify.toml` and build configurations.
*   [x] **Legacy Root Files**: Removed outdated `main.py` and `requirements.txt` to avoid confusion with the multi-service structure.

## 🚀 Final Step: Hugging Face Spaces Deployment

The project is now ready for the final transition to HF. The remaining requirements are:

### Task 10: Hugging Face Optimization
- [ ] **Consolidated Docker Strategy**: Create a multi-stage `Dockerfile` that builds and runs the entire stack (Redis + Web + Chat) within HF's RAM/CPU limits.
- [ ] **Port Standardization**: Configure all internal service communication to work relative to HF's public port `7860`.
- [ ] **Secret Management**: Create a mapping guide for HF Secrets (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`).
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: Configure ChromaDB to use HF's persistent storage volumes if available, or optimize for lightning-fast re-indexing on cold starts.
- [ ] **README Overhaul**: Author a professional `README.md` that serves as the "Front Door" to your Hugging Face Space.
